Demo of the ArcGIS Server SOS Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is the {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE}link}} to a demo instance of the ArcGIS Server SOS Extension.
  This demo instance serves an air quality data set from the {{{http://www.eea.europa.eu/}European Environment Agency (EEA)}}. Please find {{{http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/resources/about-the-data}here}} more information about the data provided by EEA.
  
  The excerpt of the EEA air quality data set used here includes 1.000.000 observations from around 1.500 air quality stations across Europe over a time span of one month. The figure below shows the network of air quality stations (source of background image is {{{http://www.nps.gov/}US National Park Service}})

  In the following, example requests for the ArcGIS SOS Extension demo instance are presented.

  In ESRI's ArcMap, you can access the following <<Map Service>> upon which this SOE is based: {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer}http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer}}

  The actual ArcGIS Server SOS Extension cannot be accessed from ArcMap, since it adds functionality which is not yet covered by ESRI's REST API.

  Via the specified REST API of the SOE, you can access the three resources offered by the SOE:

  [[1]] <<Procedures (=sensors)>> can be accessed, e.g.:

  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/procedures/CO-SensorNetwork}http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/procedures/CO-SensorNetwork}}

  [[2]] <<Features (of interest)>> can be queried, i.e., you can define filter parameters to receive a restricted set of features. 
  
  For example, you can query features, by their ID, e.g. the following 4 features:
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features/query?feature=BETR701,DETH096,IT1679A,AT31401}http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features/query?feature=BETR701,DETH096,IT1679A,AT31401}}

  All IDs of registered features can be received like this:
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features}
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features}}

  The feature with the property 'Ozone', observed by the sensor 'Ozone-SensorNetwork', at a given point position can be queried this way:
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features/query?observedProperty=http%3A%2F%2Fsweet.jpl.nasa.gov%2Fontology%2Fsubstance.owl%23Ozone&amp;procedure=Ozone-SensorNetwork&amp;spatialFilter=\{x:13.128932000000077,y:48.97240100000005,spatialReference:\{wkid:4326\}\}}\
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/features/query\
  ?observedProperty=http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/ontology/substance.owl#Ozone&amp;procedure=Ozone-SensorNetwork\
  &amp;spatialFilter=\{x:13.128932000000077,y:48.97240100000005,spatialReference:\{wkid:4326\}\}}}

  [[3]] <<Observations>> can be queried.
  
  The entry point URL to the observations resource shows information about the available observations (they are grouped in so called 'observation offerings'):
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations}
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations}}

  With the information provided by the observation offerings, the actual observations can be queried. For example, all observations for the features 'BETR701,DERP023,CH0049A', grouped by the observation offering 'CO-Offering', and measured on the 2011-10-18 at 10 o'clock (note that time zones conversion is also done by the SOE) can be accessed:
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query?offering=CO-Offering&amp;featureOfInterest=BETR701,DERP023,CH0049A&amp;temporalFilter=equals:2011-10-18T10:00:00%2B00:00}
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query\
  ?offering=CO-Offering\
  &amp;featureOfInterest=BETR701,DERP023,CH0049A\
  &amp;temporalFilter=equals:2011-10-18T10:00:00+00:00}}

  Or, all carbon monoxide measurements greater than 2500 can be queried:
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query?observedProperty=http%3A%2F%2Fsweet.jpl.nasa.gov%2Fontology%2Fsubstance.owl%23CarbonMonoxide&amp;where=NUMERIC_VALUE>2500}
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query\
  ?observedProperty=http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/ontology/substance.owl#CarbonMonoxide\
  &amp;where=NUMERIC_VALUE>2500}}

  Or, all observations measured by the procedure 'Ozone-SensorNetwork' within a given BBOX and 'during' a given time period can be queried:
  
  {{{http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query?procedure=Ozone-SensorNetwork&amp;spatialFilter=\{xmin:0.0,ymin:40.0,xmax:2.0,ymax:43.0,spatialReference:\{wkid:4326\}\}&amp;temporalFilter=during:2011-10-19T15:00:00%2B02:00,2011-10-20T00:00:00%2B02:00}
  http://ags.dev.52north.org:6080/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualityEurope/MapServer/exts/SosSOE/observations/query\
    ?procedure=Ozone-SensorNetwork\
    &amp;spatialFilter=\{xmin:0.0,ymin:40.0,xmax:2.0,ymax:43.0,spatialReference:\{wkid:4326\}\}\
    &amp;temporalFilter=during:2011-10-19T15:00:00+02:00,2011-10-20T00:00:00+02:00}}
