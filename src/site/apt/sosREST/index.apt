SOS RESTful Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  The SOS RESTful Extension provides a means for accessing and manipulating SOS resources (i.e., observations, capabilities, offerings, sensors, and features) in a RESTful way - that means, plain HTTP methods (GET, DELETE, POST, PUT) can be used to interact with those resources. Using REST makes client development easy and lightweight.

  The implementation of this RESTful extension is based on the 52\xB0North SOS and can be easily added to existing deployments of our {{{../sos/index.html}SOS 4.0}} implementation.
  
  The SOS RESTful Add-on is realized as a specific <binding> for the SOS 4.0 - adding REST functionality beyond the standard KVP and SOAP bindings.
  
  The figure below gives an overview of this Add-on and the implemented REST API.
