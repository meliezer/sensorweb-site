amused - Apache Muse Derivate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Amused is a fork of the discontinued {{{http://ws.apache.org/muse/}Apache Muse Project}}. The
	{{{../ses/0.0.1/index.html}Sensor Event Service}}
	started to integrate this framework in a very early stage. Certainly, Muse got retired officially in 2010
	and we decided to maintain the source code and improve it by fixing bugs and incorporate enhancements.

* OASIS Web Services / WS-* Implementation

	Amused provides a Java implementation of the OASIS standards family for Web Services Notification (WS-N), including
	WS-Brokered Notification, WS-Topics and WS-Resource Framework (WSRF). It uses SOAP 1.2 for message transportation.

* Code Base

	The code base for the fork is the official Apache Muse release version 2.2.0. Our source repository provides a
	{{{https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/incubation/amused/tags/muse-2.2.0-original/}tag of this version}}. 

	The module structure stayed generally the same, but we applied new naming and did some adjustments to meet
	Maven 3.x requirements.

* Releases

** Version 1.0.0

      *	Binary download is currently only available through our Maven Release repository:
	{{{http://52north.org/maven/repo/releases/org/n52/amused/}http://52north.org/maven/repo/releases/org/n52/amused/}}.
	
      * Source code is available as a tag in the SVN repository:
	{{{https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/incubation/amused/tags/1.0.0-release/}https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/incubation/amused/tags/1.0.0-release/}}
